### Project Title
Financial Portfolio Optimization

## Problem Statement
Investors want high returns with low risk but every asset behaves differently so choosing the right mix is hard. The Markowitz Mean–Variance framework models a portfolio using its expected return and risk. Expected return reflects average profit, while variance measures fluctuations. Markowitz showed that the best portfolios lie on the efficient frontier. Our goal is to use optimization to construct a portfolio that achieves a target return with the lowest possible risk.

## Libraries used
